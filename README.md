I am always finding new things to be interested in. I've been writing programs since I was 10, making stick figure games in Visual Basic 6.

I am also a certified forklift driver.

## Artsey/Ardux

About a year ago I was looking into handheld keyboards and I came across [Artsey](https://artsey.io/), an 8 key keyboard capable of typing any character. I was intrigued. I ordered a [Paintbrush](https://github.com/arduxio/thepaintbrush) and started learning.

It has been about a year, and my typing speed is roughly where I was with qwerty. 50ish wpm. I was never the fastest typist.

These days I daily drive half of a slightly modified 40 percent keyboard I call the Fatlad. I've found a wonderful space for others like me who are interested in pushing the boundaries of traditional input devices. We call ourselves [Inkeys](#org8398b19), short for Inclusive Keyboards, but really we discuss any kind of alternate system.
